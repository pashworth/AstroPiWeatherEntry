  +  This has been written by Nicole Ashworth for the Astro Pi competition, 2015.                                        +
  +  This program is designed to compare the average weather of England with the Interntional Space Station.             +
  +  The average weather file is from Heathrow airport of the year 2014.                                                 +
  +                                                                                                                      +
  +  Originally, the program was going to take the temperature and humidity from the Astro Pi sensors                    +
  +  but the board got hot and the sensor picked up the heat of the board                                                +
  +  and the humidity was not included in the file we found of average weather.                                          +
  +  It was going to give the number of rainy days missed, but there is no specific date of takeoff so it was not done.  +
  +                                                                                                                      +
